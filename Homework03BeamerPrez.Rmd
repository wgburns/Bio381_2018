##The first of the beautiful pictures is a site map 
\begin{picture}(320,250)
\put(85,75){\includegraphics[height=6cm]{Map1.jpg}}
\put(00,60){\begin{minipage}[t]{1\linewidth}
{Choose a point on the unit circle. Connect it to the origin with a line of length one, and denote the angle between that line and the horizontal coordinate axis by $\theta$.}
\end{minipage}}
\end{picture}

##My second slide will have some bullet points 
- science is fun 
- often times it is hard 
- but then you always remember it's fun to be outside collecting data!
