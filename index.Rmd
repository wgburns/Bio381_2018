<img src = "WBWater.jpg" width = "400"" height = "275" align = "left" hspace = "5" />     My name is Wilton Burns and I'm pursuring my PhD at the University of Vermont researching nutrient dynamics and phytoplankton blooms in Lake Champlain. I'm funded as a graduate research assistant on the Vermont EPSCoR Basin Resilience to Extreme Events (BREE) grant so am particularly interested in how extreme meterological events impact nutrient cycling and algae blooms. 
Check out the [Saving our Waters VT PBS](https://www.vermontpbs.org/water/) mini-series that highlights BREE research.
